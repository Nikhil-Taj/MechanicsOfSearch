# MechanicsOfSearch
This project is an information retrieval system built for the Cranfield dataset, implementing TF-IDF, BM25, and Jelinek-Mercer Language Model to rank and retrieve relevant documents based on user queries. The system processes, indexes, ranks, and evaluates results using standard retrieval metrics (MAP, P@5, NDCG).
