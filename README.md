# Search Engine for the Cranfield dataset
🔍 This project is an information retrieval system built for the Cranfield dataset, implementing TF-IDF, BM25, and Jelinek-Mercer Language Model to rank and retrieve relevant documents based on user queries. The system processes, indexes, ranks, and evaluates results using standard retrieval metrics (MAP, P@5, NDCG).
# 📌 Features
Efficient Indexing: Parses XML-based Cranfield dataset, processes text with tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and query expansion.
# 🏁 Ranking Models:
TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)
BM25 (Best Matching 25)
Jelinek-Mercer Language Model (Smoothing-based retrieval)
Query Expansion: Uses WordNet synonyms to improve retrieval.
TREC-style Evaluation: Measures performance using MAP, P@5, and NDCG.
